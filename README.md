"I have extensive experience developing WordPress websites and Shopify stores. One notable project was a WordPress site for a local business, where I implemented a custom theme to align with their brand identity. Key features included an intuitive navigation menu, responsive design, and seamless integration with e-commerce plugins for online transactions. I addressed challenges related to third-party plugin compatibility and optimized the site for performance. The result was a 30% increase in online sales and positive feedback on the user-friendlyÂ interface."
